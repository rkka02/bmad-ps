- **SCAMPER Applications**: Applicable to any domain - substitute concepts, combine ideas, adapt from other fields
- **Six Thinking Hats**: Universal perspective-taking across all domains of inquiry

**Layer 4: Universal Systems Thinking**
- **System Boundary Definition**: Define scope of inquiry regardless of domain
- **Element Relationship Mapping**: Identify connections between components in any system
- **Leverage Point Identification**: Find high-impact intervention opportunities
- **Feedback Loop Analysis**: Understand self-reinforcing and balancing dynamics

**Layer 5: Visual/Conceptual Connection Mapping**
- **Concept Visualization**: Create visual representations of abstract ideas
- **Cross-Domain Pattern Recognition**: Identify patterns that transcend specific domains
- **Relationship Diagramming**: Map conceptual relationships visually
- **Insight Connection Networks**: Visualize how insights connect across thinking layers

**Enhanced Universal Web Search Terminology**:
- "field experts" instead of "industry leaders"
- "domain best practices" instead of "business practices"
- "methodological approaches" instead of "business approaches"
- "scholarly research" instead of "market research"
- "case studies across disciplines" instead of "business case studies"

### Universal Solve Methodology - USGS Framework

**Framework Name**: **Universal Solution Generation System (USGS)**
**Core Innovation**: Domain-agnostic systematic solution generation combining morphological analysis, creative problem solving, synectics, and scientific methodology applicable to any problem domain

#### Universal Solution Categories (replacing Ten Types of Innovation)

**1. Conceptual Solutions**
- **Definitional**: How we define or categorize the phenomenon
- **Theoretical**: What theoretical framework explains the situation
- **Perspective**: From what viewpoint we approach the problem
- **Scope**: How we bound the problem space

**2. Methodological Solutions**
- **Process**: What systematic approach we use
- **Tools**: What instruments or techniques we employ  
- **Sequence**: In what order we approach sub-problems
- **Integration**: How we combine multiple approaches

**3. Structural Solutions**
- **Organization**: How elements are arranged or structured
- **Relationships**: How components interact with each other
- **Hierarchy**: What levels of analysis or intervention exist
- **Boundaries**: How we separate or connect system elements

**4. Operational Solutions**
- **Implementation**: How we put solutions into practice
- **Monitoring**: How we track progress and outcomes
- **Adaptation**: How we modify approaches based on feedback
- **Validation**: How we verify solution effectiveness

#### Universal Solution Generation Process

**Cycle Structure (Complexity-Adaptive)**:
- **Simple (2 cycles)**: Morphological analysis + Creative refinement
- **Medium (3 cycles)**: Morphological + Synectics + Scientific validation
- **Complex (4 cycles)**: Full CPS model + Morphological + Synectics + Scientific method
- **Wicked (5 cycles)**: All frameworks + Cross-domain exploration + Emergent adaptation

**Universal Innovation Horizons (replacing McKinsey business model)**:
- **Foundation**: Optimize existing approaches and understanding
- **Extension**: Adapt and expand current frameworks to new contexts  
- **Transformation**: Create entirely new ways of approaching the problem

**Universal Web Search Enhancement**:
- "morphological analysis applications {problem domain}" instead of innovation terminology
- "creative problem solving {field} breakthrough approaches"
- "synectics applications {domain} cross-pollination examples"
- "scientific method adaptation {problem type} systematic investigation"
- "solution validation {domain} effectiveness assessment"
