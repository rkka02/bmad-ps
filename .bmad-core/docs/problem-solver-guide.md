# BMad Problem-Solver Agent (Sage) - User Guide

## üß† Meet Sage: Your Problem-Solving Specialist

The Problem-Solver agent embodies the methodologies of exceptional problem solvers like Richard Feynman, Charlie Munger, and Elon Musk. Sage applies 15+ systematic frameworks to analyze complex problems, generate innovative solutions, and support high-stakes decision-making.

## When to Use Problem-Solver

### ‚úÖ Ideal Scenarios
- **Complex Multi-Domain Problems**: Issues spanning technical, business, and user experience
- **Unknown Root Causes**: Problems where the source isn't immediately apparent  
- **Innovation Required**: Situations needing creative, non-obvious solutions
- **High-Stakes Decisions**: Choices with significant impact requiring systematic analysis
- **Technical Contradictions**: Requirements that seem mutually exclusive
- **Cross-Functional Challenges**: Problems affecting multiple teams or systems

### ‚ùå When NOT to Use
- Simple, well-understood problems with obvious solutions
- Time-critical urgent fixes where speed matters more than analysis depth
- Problems with single clear solution already identified
- Purely operational issues without strategic implications

### üéØ Problem Complexity Assessment

| Level | Characteristics | Approach |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| **Simple** | Single domain, known patterns, clear requirements | Use standard agents |
| **Moderate** | 2-3 domains, some uncertainty, multiple stakeholders | Optional problem-solver consultation |
| **Complex** | Cross-disciplinary, unknown causes, conflicting requirements | Full problem-solver engagement |
| **Wicked** | No clear definition, solutions create new problems | Iterative problem-solver cycles |

## üß™ Core Methodologies

### 1. First Principles Analysis
**Method**: Break problems to fundamental, irreducible truths
**Best For**: Challenging assumptions, breakthrough innovation
**Approach**: Feynman/Musk systematic doubt methodology

```bash
*analyze-problem
# Systematically challenges assumptions
# Identifies fundamental constraints vs. conventional thinking  
# Reconstructs solutions from basic truths
# Output: fundamental_truths, reconstructed_solution
```

**Example**: SpaceX rocket costs - Instead of accepting industry pricing, analyzed material costs (aluminum, titanium) reaching 10x cost reduction.

### 2. Root Cause Investigation
**Method**: Multiple systematic approaches to find true causes
**Best For**: Complex failures, recurring problems
**Auto-selects**: 5 Whys (linear), Fishbone (multi-factor), Fault Tree (complex systems)

```bash
*investigate-root-cause
# Automatically chooses best method based on problem characteristics
# Validates causes with evidence requirements
# Maps cause-and-effect relationships
# Output: verified root causes with confidence levels
```

### 3. MECE Problem Decomposition
**Method**: Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive breakdown
**Best For**: Complex systems, unclear scope
**Ensures**: No overlaps, complete coverage, same abstraction levels

```bash
*decompose
# Creates hierarchical problem structure
# Validates MECE principle compliance
# Identifies leverage points and critical dependencies
# Output: structured problem hierarchy
```

### 4. Solution Synthesis (Innovation Portfolio)
**Method**: Multiple creative frameworks applied systematically
**Frameworks**: TRIZ, Lateral Thinking, Biomimicry, Design Thinking, Combinatory Play
**Best For**: Need multiple solution alternatives, innovation required

```bash
*generate-solutions
# Applies 3-5 innovation methods automatically
# Generates 3-7 diverse solution approaches
# Scores solutions on feasibility, innovation, impact
# Output: solution portfolio with implementation approaches
```

**TRIZ Example**: Technical contradiction "faster processing requires more energy" ‚Üí Apply Principle #15 (Segmentation) ‚Üí Distributed processing solution.

### 5. Decision Analysis (MCDA)
**Method**: Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis with sensitivity testing
**Best For**: Multiple options with trade-offs, high-stakes choices
**Features**: Weighted scoring, sensitivity analysis, scenario testing

```bash
*evaluate-decisions
# Systematically scores alternatives against criteria
# Provides weighted recommendations with confidence levels
# Tests decision robustness through sensitivity analysis
# Output: quantified decision with rationale

## üîß Best Practices

### 1. Start with Problem Definition
Always begin with comprehensive problem scoping before jumping to solutions.

### 2. Apply Multiple Methods
Complex problems benefit from multiple analytical approaches for validation.

### 3. Document Decision Rationale
Use decision records for important choices to preserve institutional learning.

### 4. Iterate and Refine
First analysis is rarely complete - use feedback loops for improvement.

### 5. Collaborate with Domain Experts
Leverage other agents for specialized knowledge and validation.

### 6. Validate with Data
Test hypotheses empirically rather than relying on theoretical analysis alone.

## üö® Troubleshooting

| Issue | Diagnosis | Solution |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| "This seems like overkill" | Problem too simple for systematic analysis | Use standard agents instead |
| "Too many solution options" | Need stricter evaluation criteria | Apply more selective scoring |
| "Root cause still unclear" | Insufficient data or wrong method | Try different investigation approach |
| "Solutions seem obvious" | May need more creative methods | Apply lateral thinking or biomimicry |
| "Decision keeps changing" | Inadequate sensitivity analysis | Run robustness testing |

### Debug Commands
```bash
*yolo          # Skip confirmations for rapid iteration
*status        # Check current analysis phase and progress
*method-select # Get guidance on appropriate methodology
```

- **Expert Bias**: Assuming domain knowledge always helps creativity

## üèÜ Success Indicators

You'll know problem-solver is working well when:
- Problems are clearly defined before solution development starts
- Multiple innovative solution approaches are generated consistently
- Decisions can be clearly explained and defended to stakeholders
- Root causes are validated with evidence rather than assumed
- Solutions address structural issues rather than just symptoms
- Decision quality improves over time with institutional learning
