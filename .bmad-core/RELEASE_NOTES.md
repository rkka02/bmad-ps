**Release Date**: August 18, 2025  
**Version**: BMad 4.39.2-problem-solver  
**Agent Name**: Sage 🧠  

### ✨ What's New

#### Meta-Cognitive Problem-Solving Capability
BMad now includes a dedicated Problem-Solver agent that applies 15+ systematic methodologies from multiple disciplines to tackle complex, cross-disciplinary challenges.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **First Principles Analysis**: Break problems to fundamental truths (Feynman/Musk methodology)
- **Root Cause Investigation**: 5 Whys, Fishbone Diagrams, Fault Tree Analysis
- **MECE Problem Decomposition**: Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive breakdown
- **Innovation Frameworks**: TRIZ, Lateral Thinking, Biomimicry, Design Thinking
- **Decision Analysis**: Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) with sensitivity testing

#### New Workflow: Complex Problem-Solving
```
Problem Definition → Root Cause Analysis → Solution Generation → 
Technical/Business Validation → Decision Matrix → Decision Record
```
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for comprehensive analysis
- **Outputs**: 6 structured documents with full analysis trail
- **Integration**: Seamless handoffs with existing agents

#### Interactive Document Templates
- **Problem Definition Template**: Stakeholder analysis, constraint validation, success metrics
- **Solution Matrix Template**: Weighted scoring, sensitivity analysis, scenario testing  
- **Decision Record Template**: ADR-style with context, alternatives, consequences

### 🔧 Enhanced Workflows

#### Integration Points Added
All existing workflows now support optional problem-solver consultation:
- **Complex Requirements**: Deep analysis before development starts
- **Architecture Decisions**: Systematic evaluation of technical options
- **Innovation Challenges**: Creative solution generation when standard approaches insufficient

#### Agent Team Updates
- **Team Fullstack**: Now includes problem-solver for comprehensive projects
- **Team No-UI**: Problem-solver available for complex backend challenges
- **Team All**: Automatic inclusion via wildcard matching
