# BMad Problem-Solver Agent Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This implementation plan outlines the integration of a **Problem-Solver Agent** into the BMad framework, embodying the philosophical and methodological approaches of exceptional problem solvers. The agent will enhance BMad's capability to handle complex, cross-disciplinary challenges through systematic decomposition, root cause analysis, and innovative solution frameworks.

## 1. Problem Definition and Scope

### 1.1 Current State Analysis (5 Whys Applied)

**Problem**: BMad lacks a dedicated agent for complex problem-solving scenarios that span multiple domains.

1. **Why?** Current agents are specialized in specific domains (PM for requirements, Architect for technical design)
2. **Why?** The framework was designed for linear software development workflows
3. **Why?** Traditional development assumes well-defined problems with clear solutions
4. **Why?** Most projects don't require deep problem analysis beyond requirements gathering
5. **Why?** Complex, novel, or cross-disciplinary problems were not the initial focus

**Root Cause**: BMad needs a meta-cognitive layer for handling ill-defined, complex problems requiring multiple analytical frameworks.

### 1.2 Objectives (SMART Goals)

1. **Specific**: Integrate a Problem-Solver agent that applies 15+ problem-solving methodologies
2. **Measurable**: Enable resolution of complex problems in 3 categories: technical, organizational, strategic
3. **Achievable**: Leverage existing BMad architecture and agent interaction patterns
4. **Relevant**: Enhance BMad's capability for innovation and complex project scenarios
5. **Time-bound**: Complete implementation in 4 phases over 2 sprints

## Conclusion

This implementation plan applies problem-solving methodologies to its own creation, demonstrating the recursive nature of the Problem-Solver agent's capabilities. By integrating this agent, BMad will gain a powerful meta-cognitive layer capable of handling complex, cross-disciplinary challenges that current specialized agents cannot address individually.

The phased approach ensures systematic validation at each stage, while the integration strategy preserves existing workflow integrity. Success depends on clear boundary definition with existing agents and comprehensive documentation of use cases.

**Recommended Decision**: Proceed with Phase 1 (Foundation) as proof-of-concept, then evaluate before full implementation.
