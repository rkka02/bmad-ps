# Iterative Thinking Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented an **Iterative Thinking Framework** for the BMad Problem-Solver agent that enforces complexity-adaptive, step-by-step analysis. The system transforms ad-hoc problem solving into disciplined, systematic thinking that scales appropriately with problem complexity.

## Key Innovation

**Problem**: Users often jump to solutions without systematic analysis, leading to surface-level problem solving that misses root causes and innovative opportunities.

**Solution**: Enforce iterative thinking through:
1. **Complexity Assessment** → Determine appropriate thinking depth
2. **Adaptive Planning** → Generate step-by-step plans (3/5/7/10 steps)  
3. **Sequential Execution** → Enforce step completion before advancement
4. **Progressive Learning** → Build insights cumulatively through validation gates

## Implementation Components

### 1. Complexity Assessment System
**File**: `.bmad-core/tasks/complexity-assessment.md`

**Function**: Evaluates problems across 5 dimensions to determine thinking depth:
- Domain Breadth (1-4): How many disciplines involved
- Stakeholder Alignment (1-4): Level of agreement among parties
- Solution Uncertainty (1-4): How clear the solution path is
- Impact Scope (1-4): Breadth and reversibility of consequences  
- Time Pressure (1-4): Urgency vs thoroughness trade-offs

**Output**: Total score (5-20) → Complexity Level → Recommended thinking steps
- Simple (5-8): 3 steps
- Medium (9-12): 5 steps
- Complex (13-16): 7 steps  
- Wicked (17-20): 10 steps

### 2. Adaptive Thinking Plan Generation
**File**: `.bmad-core/tasks/create-thinking-plan.md`

**Function**: Creates complexity-appropriate thinking plans with:
- Sequential step structure with prerequisites
- Specific focus questions for each step
- Designated methods and approaches
- Required deliverables and validation criteria

**Example - Medium Complexity (5 Steps)**:
1. Problem Scoping & Stakeholder Analysis
2. Root Cause Investigation
3. Solution Space Exploration
4. Trade-off Analysis & Evaluation
5. Decision & Implementation Strategy

### 3. Step Execution Enforcement
**File**: `.bmad-core/tasks/execute-step.md`

**Function**: Enforces disciplined step-by-step progression:
- **Sequential Progression**: Cannot skip to step N+2 without completing N+1
- **Validation Gates**: Each step requires completion criteria before advancing
- **Insight Capture**: Force documentation of learnings before progression
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains thinking context across session interruptions
- **Pure Iteration**: Focus on systematic thinking without time pressure

**Enforcement Logic**:
```python
def can_execute_step(current_step, target_step, completed_steps):
    # Cannot skip ahead more than 1 step
    if target_step > current_step + 1:
        return False, "Must complete steps sequentially"
    
    # Must complete all prerequisite steps
    for i in range(1, target_step):
        if i not in completed_steps:
            return False, f"Step {i} must be completed first"
    
    return True, "Step execution allowed"
```

### 4. Enhanced Agent Definition
**File**: `.bmad-core/agents/problem-solver-iterative.md`

**Function**: BMad agent configuration with new iterative thinking capabilities:

**New Commands**:
- `*assess-complexity`: Evaluate problem complexity
- `*create-thinking-plan`: Generate step-by-step plan
- `*execute-step`: Execute current step with validation
- `*plan-status`: Show progress and next actions
- `*thinking-summary`: Synthesize insights across steps

**Behavioral Rules**:
- For any substantial problem, immediately suggest complexity assessment
- Enforce sequential thinking progression
- Capture insights progressively throughout analysis
- Maintain thinking context across session interruptions

### 5. Validation and Testing
**File**: `iterative_thinking_test.py`

**Function**: Comprehensive testing of the iterative thinking system:
- Enhanced agent file structure validation
- Task file format compliance
- Complexity assessment logic verification
- Step execution enforcement testing
- Agent command integration validation

## Usage Examples

### Simple Problem Example
```
Problem: "API response time is too slow"
Complexity Assessment: Simple (score 7)
→ 3-step plan

Step 1: Problem Definition
- Define "too slow" precisely, identify affected endpoints
- Success criteria: <200ms for 95% of requests

Step 2: Solution Generation
- Options: Caching, indexing, query optimization
- Pros/cons analysis of each

Step 3: Implementation Plan
- Selected: Database indexing + Redis caching
- Phased rollout with success metrics
```

### Complex Problem Example
```
Problem: "Startup needs to pivot but unsure in which direction"
Complexity Assessment: Complex (score 15)
→ 7-step plan

Step 1: Multi-Dimensional Analysis
- Map market forces, team capabilities, constraints, customer feedback

Step 2: First Principles Decomposition
- What business are we really in? What value do we create?

Step 3: Root Cause Investigation
- Why is current approach failing? Market/execution/product-market fit?

Step 4: Constraint & Opportunity Mapping
- What limits options? What unique assets enable breakthrough?

Step 5: Innovation & Solution Generation

Step 7: Implementation Strategy
- Phased pivot plan with validation milestones
```

## Integration with BMad Framework

### Backward Compatibility
- Original problem-solver agent remains available

- Preserves session context across agent handoffs

### State Management
The system tracks:

- `current_step`: Which step is active or next
- `completed_steps`: Steps finished with validation status
- `captured_insights`: Key learnings from each step
- `decision_trail`: Important decisions made during analysis
- `session_context`: Problem context and accumulated understanding
