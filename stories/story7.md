# BMad Problem-Solver Agent Guide

## Overview

The Problem-Solver agent (Sage) is a meta-cognitive specialist that applies 15+ problem-solving methodologies from multiple disciplines to analyze complex problems, generate innovative solutions, and support systematic decision-making.

## When to Use Problem-Solver

### Ideal Scenarios
- **Complex Multi-Domain Problems**: Issues spanning technical, business, and user experience
- **Unknown Root Causes**: Problems where the cause isn't immediately apparent
- **Innovation Required**: Situations needing creative, non-obvious solutions
- **High-Stakes Decisions**: Choices with significant impact requiring systematic analysis
- **Technical Contradictions**: Problems where requirements seem mutually exclusive

### Problem Complexity Matrix

| Complexity | Characteristics | Recommended Approach |
|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Simple** | Single domain, known patterns | Use standard agents |
| **Moderate** | 2-3 domains, some uncertainty | Optional problem-solver consultation |
| **Complex** | Cross-disciplinary, unknown causes | Primary problem-solver involvement |
| **Wicked** | No clear definition, evolving | Continuous problem-solver engagement |

## Getting Started

### Activation

```bash
# From BMad Orchestrator
*agent problem-solver

# Direct activation
@problem-solver
```

### Basic Commands

```bash
*help                     # Show all available commands
*analyze-problem          # First principles analysis
*investigate-root-cause   # 5 Whys, Fishbone, Fault Tree
*decompose               # MECE problem breakdown
*generate-solutions      # TRIZ, Lateral Thinking, Biomimicry
*evaluate-decisions      # Multi-criteria decision analysis
```

## Core Methodologies

### 1. First Principles Analysis
Breaks problems down to fundamental truths, removing assumptions:

```bash
*analyze-problem
# Follows Feynman/Musk approach
# Output: fundamental_truths, reconstructed_solution
```

### 2. Root Cause Investigation
Multiple methods for finding true causes:

```bash
*investigate-root-cause
# Methods: 5 Whys, Fishbone Diagram, Fault Tree Analysis
# Automatically selects based on problem complexity
```

### 3. Problem Decomposition (MECE)
Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive breakdown:

```bash
*decompose
# Creates hierarchical problem structure
# Validates no overlaps, complete coverage
```

### 4. Solution Generation
Innovation frameworks for creative solutions:

```bash
*generate-solutions
# Methods: TRIZ, Lateral Thinking, Biomimicry, Design Thinking
# Generates 3-7 diverse solution approaches
```

### 5. Decision Analysis
Systematic evaluation of options:

```bash
*evaluate-decisions
# Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)
# Weighted scoring with sensitivity analysis
```

## Document Templates

### Problem Definition Template
Comprehensive problem scoping:

```bash
*create-problem-def
# Interactive template with:
# - Stakeholder analysis
# - Constraints and assumptions
# - Success metrics
# - Initial root cause hypotheses
```

### Solution Matrix Template
Systematic solution comparison:

```bash
*create-solution-matrix
# Features:
# - Multi-option scoring
# - Weighted criteria evaluation
# - Sensitivity analysis
# - Risk assessment
```

### Decision Record Template
ADR-style decision documentation:

```bash
*create-decision-record
# Captures:
# - Context and forces
# - Options considered
# - Decision rationale
# - Consequences and trade-offs
```

## Workflow Integration

### Complex Problem-Solving Workflow

```bash
*workflow complex-problem-solving
```

Flow: Problem Definition → Root Cause Analysis → Solution Generation → 
      Technical/Business Validation → Decision Matrix → Decision Record

### Enhanced Development Workflows

Problem-solver integrates at key points:
- **After Project Brief**: Deep problem analysis
- **Before Architecture**: Technical decision support
- **During Development**: Debugging complex issues
- **Legacy Analysis**: Systematic refactoring strategy

## Collaboration Patterns

### Working with Other Agents

#### Analyst Handoff
```
Analyst → Problem-Solver: "Requires systematic decomposition"
Problem-Solver → Analyst: "Research needed in 3 areas (see decomposition)"
```

#### Architect Collaboration
```
Architect → Problem-Solver: "Technical contradiction needs resolution"
Problem-Solver → Architect: "TRIZ solution: Segmentation principle applied"
```

#### PM Decision Support
```
PM → Problem-Solver: "Multiple product directions possible"
Problem-Solver → PM: "Solution 2 scores highest on business value (see matrix)"
```

## Examples and Use Cases

### Example 1: Performance Problem

```bash
# Start with problem definition
*create-problem-def
# Problem: System response time degraded 300%

# Investigate root cause
*investigate-root-cause
# Method: Fault Tree Analysis
# Found: Database queries + Memory leaks

# Generate solutions
*generate-solutions
# Applied: TRIZ contradiction resolution
# Generated: Query optimization, Caching layer, Service redesign

# Evaluate options
*create-solution-matrix
# Recommendation: Query optimization (highest ROI)

# Document decision
*create-decision-record
# ADR-001: Implement query optimization strategy
```

### Example 2: Innovation Challenge

```bash
# Define innovation need
*analyze-problem
# Challenge: Reduce deployment time by 90%

# Apply lateral thinking
*generate-solutions
# Random input: "Pizza delivery"
# Insight: Hot-swap deployments like fresh pizza rotation

# Systematic evaluation
*evaluate-decisions
# Winner: Blue-green deployment with feature flags
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Problem Definition
Always begin by clearly defining the problem before jumping to solutions.

### 2. Use Multiple Methods
Complex problems benefit from multiple analytical approaches.

### 3. Document Decisions
Use decision records for important choices to preserve rationale.

### 4. Iterate on Solutions
First solutions are rarely optimal - use feedback loops.

### 5. Validate with Domain Experts
Collaborate with other agents for domain-specific validation.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Method not applicable" | Problem too simple - use standard agents |
| "Too many solution options" | Apply stricter evaluation criteria |
| "Root cause unclear" | Gather more data, try different investigation method |
| "Conflicting requirements" | Perfect case for TRIZ contradiction resolution |

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable detailed logging
*yolo  # Skip confirmations
*status  # Check current analysis phase
```

## Adding Problem-Solver to Existing Projects

### Step 1: Update Agent Teams

```yaml
# .bmad-core/agent-teams/your-team.yaml
agents:
  - existing-agents...
  - problem-solver  # Add this line
```

### Step 2: Modify Workflows

Insert problem-solver at decision points:

```yaml
# After requirements gathering
- agent: problem-solver
  creates: problem-analysis.md
  optional: true
  condition: has_complexity

# Before architecture decisions
- agent: problem-solver
  creates: technical-decisions.md
  optional: true
  condition: needs_decision_support
```

### Step 3: Define Handoff Protocols

```yaml
# Handoff from your agent to problem-solver
handoff:
  from: your-agent
  to: problem-solver
  trigger: "complexity_threshold_exceeded"
  provides: context-document.md
  expects: problem-analysis.md
```

def process_problem_solver_output(output_file):
    with open(output_file, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    # Extract YAML section
    yaml_start = content.find('```yaml')
    yaml_end = content.find('```', yaml_start + 6)
    yaml_content = content[yaml_start+7:yaml_end]
    
    # Parse structured data
    data = yaml.safe_load(yaml_content)
    return data
```

### Template Variables

Templates support variable substitution:

```yaml

def test_problem_solver_integration():
    # Load agent
    agent = load_agent('problem-solver')
    assert agent.id == 'problem-solver'
    
    # Test command
    result = agent.execute('analyze-problem', problem="Test")
    assert 'fundamental_truths' in result
```

### Integration Test

```bash
# Test workflow with problem-solver
echo "*workflow complex-problem-solving" | bmad-orchestrator
```

## Migration Guide

### From Manual Analysis

Before:
```markdown
# Ad-hoc problem analysis
- Some root causes identified
- Solutions brainstormed informally
```

After:
```bash
*agent problem-solver
*investigate-root-cause  # Systematic root cause analysis
*generate-solutions      # Structured innovation methods
*create-decision-record  # Documented decision
```

### From Simple Decision Making

Before:
```markdown
# Pro/con list
Option A: Pros... Cons...
Option B: Pros... Cons...
```

After:
```bash
*create-solution-matrix  # Weighted multi-criteria analysis
# Includes sensitivity analysis
# Provides confidence levels
```

## Performance Considerations

- Agent loads in <100ms
- Templates parse in <50ms
- Workflow execution scales linearly with steps
- No blocking operations in tasks

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Found

```bash
# Check installation
ls -la .bmad-core/agents/problem-solver.md

# Verify in team config
grep problem-solver .bmad-core/agent-teams/*.yaml
```

### Task Execution Fails

```bash
# Check task file exists
ls -la .bmad-core/tasks/[task-name].md

# Validate YAML output
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('output.md'))"
```

### Template Processing Issues

```bash
# Validate template YAML
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('template.yaml'))"

# Check elicitation points
grep "elicit: true" template.yaml
```
```
